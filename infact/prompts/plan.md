# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The current knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the Claim so far. Hence, **you need to find more evidence**. Your task is to propose a set of actions which aim to retrieve evidence to answer all open questions from the Record. Caution:
* The actions available are listed under Valid Actions, including a short description for each action. No other actions are possible at this moment. 
* For each action, use the formatting as specified in Valid Actions.
* Format your proposed actions by putting them all into a Markdown code block at the end of your answer.
* Propose as few actions as possible, but as much as needed. Do not propose similar actions.
* Be brief, do not justify your proposed actions.
