# Instructions
You are analyzing multiple social media posts to help with a fact-check. **Your task is to synthesize key takeaways from ALL the social media content provided that are directly relevant to the fact-check, with CRITICAL emphasis on source credibility and evidence quality**.

**CRITICAL Rules:**
* **Refer to sources by their actual names** (e.g., "r/todayilearned", "@username") - NOT "Source 1", "Source 2", etc.
* **Avoid quality judgments**: Do not evaluate whether evidence is "low quality", "lacks substantiation", or "insufficient" - just extract what's there

**Credibility categories provided:**
* **entirely credible & mostly credible**: High credibility - but verify they have authoritative sources
* **moderately credible**: Moderate credibility - but verify claims are substantiated
* **somewhat credible & entirely uncredible**: Low credibility - treat with high skepticism

**What to extract:**
* External source references (authoritative vs. dubious)
* Media content with provenance (verified vs. unverified)
* Expert commentary vs. speculation
* Contradictory information between posts that might highlight different perspectives

**Additional rules:**
* Refer to sources by their actual names (e.g., "r/todayilearned", "@username") - NOT "Source 1", "Source 2", etc.
* Avoid quality judgments: Do not evaluate whether evidence is "low quality", "lacks substantiation", or "insufficient" - just extract what's there
