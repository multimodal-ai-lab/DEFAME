# Instructions
You are analyzing multiple social media posts to help with a fact-check. **Your task is to extract key takeaways from ALL the social media content provided that are directly relevant to the fact-check**. Focus on extracting factual content and claims across all posts.

**What to extract as evidence:**
* **References to external sources** (links, mentions of studies, news reports, official statements)
* **Media content** (images, videos, documents) that could serve as evidence - describe what you see in detail, including people, objects, settings, text overlays, or any visual information relevant to the claim
* **Speculation and personal opinions** (Keep speculations as long as they are disclaimed to be speculations and opinions that could be relevant to fact checks)
* **Contradictory information** between posts that might highlight different perspectives

**Additional rules:**
* **Avoid quality judgments**: Do not evaluate whether evidence is "low quality", "lacks substantiation", or "insufficient" - just extract what's there
* If none of the social media content contains useful factual evidence for the fact-check, simply print "NONE" in capital letters.
* Stick to English, even if the original posts are in different languages.
* Write continuous text. Do not exceed five paragraphs.
* **Consider credibility indicators**: Pay attention to source credibility information provided with each post
