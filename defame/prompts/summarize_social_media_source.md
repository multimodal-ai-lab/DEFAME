# Instructions
You just retrieved content from a social media platform to help with your fact-check. **Your task is to extract structured evidence takeaways from this content that are directly relevant to the fact-check**. Focus purely on extracting factual content and claims.

**What to extract as evidence:**
* **Specific claims or statements** made in the post that directly relate to the Record or Claim being fact-checked
* **Factual information** or data presented that can be verified or contradicted
* **References to external sources** (links, mentions of studies, news reports, official statements)
* **Media content** (images, videos, documents) that could serve as evidence - describe what you see in detail, including people, objects, settings, text overlays, or any visual information relevant to the claim
* **Direct quotes or citations** from authoritative sources mentioned in the post
* **Temporal information** about when events occurred (dates, times, sequences of events)
* **Location information** if relevant to the claim being fact-checked

**What NOT to include:**
* Author credibility assessments (already calculated in credibility score)
* Engagement metrics analysis (already incorporated in credibility evaluation)
* General opinions or personal commentary unless they contain factual claims
* Speculation or unsubstantiated rumors unless directly relevant to claim verification
* Platform-specific metadata (follower counts, verification status - already processed)

**Additional rules:**
* **Extract only factual content**: Simply state what the post says, not whether it's good evidence or bad evidence
* **Identify claim types**: Is this sharing news, making factual assertions, providing evidence, or expressing opinion?
* **Avoid quality judgments**: Do not evaluate whether evidence is "low quality", "lacks substantiation", or "insufficient" - just extract what's there
* If the social media content contains no useful factual evidence for the fact-check, simply print "NONE" in capital letters.
* Stick to English, even if the original post is in a different language.
* Write continuous text. Do not exceed three paragraphs.
* **Be purely descriptive**: State what claims are made, what sources are mentioned, what content is present - without judging its adequacy
* **Always check for media**: If there are images or videos, describe their content. If there are none, explicitly state "No images or videos present"
